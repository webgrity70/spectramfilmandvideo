							<p>fter any lab assembles film and adds leader, a proper cleaning should always applied to remove handling dirt.  At Spectra, we now use the Lipsner-Smith CF7200 ultrasonic cleaning system with all telecine prep services to ensure professional results.  The 7200 provides full immersion cleaning in a warm bath of solvent while ultrasonic agitation and gentle buffing is applied.  This is known in the industry as the safest and most effective way to clean any motion picture film (acetate, nitrate or polyester)!</p>

				<h2 class="text-center">Spectra Film Processing Policy</h2>

				<h3 class="font20 textYellow">Processing Turn Around</h3>

				<p>Film developed on a given day will usually be ready for pick-up the following day (after 12PM).  If counter pick-up is required, we will provide a courtesy phone call when film is ready.  If we are shipping film, tracking information will be emailed from the selected shipper to indicate your film is on the way.  Please check voice mail and email to determine if film has been developed!</p>

				<p>We do not run all film types daily!  We typically run just one film type per day based on when we have enough to run.  Color negative is usually run twice weekly, black and white reversal is usually run twice weekly and E-6 is usually run once weekly.  To guarantee a specific film type is run on a specific date we do provide rush service for 150.00 (developing only, rush scanning not included).</p>

				<h3 class="font20 textYellow">Processing Cut Off</h3>
				<p>Film for processing must be delivered at our counter before 12PM to make it into a planed run on the same day. Deliveries after the deadline will be held back for the next developing cycle.</p>

				<h3 class="font20 textYellow">Processing and Payment Policy</h3>
				<p>ny films you submit to us for processing must be paid in advance and will not be refundable (whether the end result has a usable image or not).  We still preform the service and use up chemistry to determine  what is on your film.  So, it is important that the potential images will be worth it to you!  </p>

				<h3 class="font20 textYellow">16 and 35 Processing Minimums</h3>
				<p>Like most labs, we must charge minimums on some of our processing services to cover our minimum labor, chemical and utility costs.  We charge an overall processing minimum of 100' for 16mm color negative, black and white reversal and E-6 ektachrome.   16mm and 35mm black and white negative has a 400' minimum.  35mm color negative has a 400' minimum.</p>
				<p>We also charge a per container 100' minimum on 16mm and 35mm films that must be stapled into a run.   For example, if one can of 16mm containing 40' and another can containing 60' are submitted together we would charge developing for 200' (100' per can).  Considering this, we suggest you try not to cut or separate film in sections that are under 100'.</p>

				<h3 class="font20 textYellow">Old Film and Foma Policy</h3>
				<p>We do not provide refunds or guarantee results on Foma or old films that may have inconsistent results due to age, manufacturing quality or chemical compatibility.  This policy includes Foma, all color VNF, 64T, 100D and 160 Ektachrome, all Kodachrome, old PlusX/TriX, old ECN-2 color negative. We can only provide you with our best effort to obtain good results!</p>


				<h3 class="font20 textYellow">Processing Limitation of Liability</h3>
				<p>We respectfully point out that our lab prices are never proportionate to the value of the film submitted to us.  Any customer media, including but not limited to film or hard drives, shall be received, developed, scanned or stored by Spectra only at the customers own risk.  Spectra does not accept responsibility for any loss or damage to client media from any cause whatsoever including negligence.  Media delivered to Spectra are accepted upon the express condition that same are insured by the owner thereof for the full amount of all risk, possible damage and loss, and said owner waives all rights of subrogation.  Except for the replacement value of raw film stock, other media submitted, or developing cost acceptance of all said media is without other warranty or liability.   We reserve the right to hold a lien thereon for general balance due to Spectra by customer whether in respect to processing, transferring, storage or otherwise. </p>

				<h3 class="font20 textYellow">Film Storage</h3>
				<p>Spectra will not be liable for orders, equipment, media (including but not limited to film, hard drives, or tape) or other materials unclaimed after 30 days.  We have the right to dispose of or charge storage for said items at our own discretion after the 30 day expiration.</p>

				<h3 class="font20 textYellow">Mislabeled, Torn or Spliced Film for Development</h3>
				<p>Any client who submits undeveloped film to us that is improperly labeled as another film process type, badly damaged (tears, creases or perforation damage) or has splices will be held responsible for all damage that may result from contaminated chemistry or film breaks. This charge will accrue any resulting damage cost including but not limited to replacing film/processing for other clients, labor costs, replacement of  contaminated chemistry, filter replacement, tank cleaning and rethreading.  These costs may run in the thousands.   With this in mind, Spectra asks that all film submitted for developing is properly labeled and in good physical condition with no splices or tears!</p>
