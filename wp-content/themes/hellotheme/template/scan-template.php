                            <p>Spectra is now one of the few sources that will provide true RGB 4K (4096
                                X 3112) scans in super 8, 16mm and 35mm from their recently installed
                                DFT Scanity RGB scanner. The line array sensor within is superior
                                because it provides all color and resolution information using 3 sensors
                                (one dedicated for each color) instead of a single Bayer filtered sensor
                                found in budget scanners. You see bayer chips being used in cheaper
                                scanners such as ScanStation, Flashscan and Blackmagic Cintel to save
                                them big on component costs. High end machines such as Scanity and
                                Spirit that utilize line array scanning are considered the first choice when
                                big budget movies or TV series require professional quality, full
                                information log file scans.</p>
                            <p>The Bayer sensor is inferior because it only involves a single chip that
                                must capture and extrapolate all color information, losing critical data in
                                the process. The Bayer sensor must use half its pixels for green, and one
                                quarter of its pixels for red and blue each. This means that only half the
                                green dye resolution and a quarter of red and blue dyes are captured.
                                The missing pixels are filled in by "interpolation" which attempts to fill in
                                the blanks. To put this into numbers, our true 4K scans will capture 38
                                Mpix per frame while a 4K Bayer sensor scan can only capture some 12
                                Mpix per frame (the rest is filled in by interpolation). That's less than a
                                third of the actual scan information that our RGB array scanners can
                                deliver! Beware of companies touting 2K or 4K scans who actually use
                                Blackmagic Cintel, Lasergraphics Scanstation or Fabriek Muller HDS
                                scanners. These machines do NOT deliver full resolution from the film!</p>

                            <p>A onelight flat pass is the only way to scan an image off film with today's traditional scanners. This includes Scanity,
                                Scanstation and all others in addition to the Golden Eye. This means that there is no color or exposure correction. All
                                the picture information remains intact; the highlights are not blown out and the shadows are not crushed. The digital
                                file is delivered "flattened" to allow a colorist full access to control highs, lows and color in a separate color
                                correction suite (such as our Nucoda bay). Our Nucoda color/exposure correction option (stage 2) should be
                                considered as a way to simplify the down stream editing and color correction process, keeping cost and delivery
                                time minimal. See the Nucoda section directly below for more information</p>

                    <h3 class="text-primary font20">We wanted to do it right the first time!</h3>
                    <p>After some testing, it was found that the only way to make
                        the lower formats shine to full potential on a Spirit SDC 2000 telecine was to design a dedicated 8mm gate
                        with proper optics. In April of 2010 Spectra gave the go-ahead on engineering plans to begin this
                        manufacturing process. Because it was new territory, everything from lenses to the gate sprockets had to
                        be custom fabricated. For the first time in the US, a new small format gate will be available at Spectra that
                        allows both super 8 and regular 8 formats to be scanned in full HD resolution off a Spirit.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-primary font20">Seeing the difference!</h3>
                    <p>The Spirit SDC 2000 produces far less noise, especially in the highlights
                        (such as white sky), when compared to older "tube" CRT telecine machines like the Cintel Millennium II or
                        Data-Mill. Additional improvements include smoother picture (less grain) and reduction in visible dirt and
                        scratches due to diffused xenon arc light source. Spirit transfers simply look better on a big plasma or
                        LCD screen. Additional testing on the new V3-S gate also reveals results that are far superior to the factory
                        DFT 16mm gate mod with improved resolution (see below). For the best 8mm broadcast HD, blow-ups or
                        historical archives, Spectra is the only professional source with the system to back it up!</p>
                    <h3 class="text-primary font20">What about the 8mm Spirit "mod" used elsewhere?</h3>
                    <p>The DFT factory mod is commonly used
                        on the Spirit as a low budget alternative to allow super 8 to be scanned using a 16mm gate. But, don't let
                        anyone fool you! The optics on a Spirit 16mm gate are fixed and only intended to focus a Super 16mm
                        frame down to a 1920 pixel line-array CCD (capturing chip). Since the added DFT modification does not
                        alter the 16mm optics for 8mm, super 8 resolution on a Spirit is limited to about 860 pixels (closer to
                        standard definition) due to a much smaller image size on the capture chip. Undesirable electronic
                        zooming (blow-up) and "up-res" must then be done internally with the scanned image so the Spirit output
                        can fit it into an HD frame. Although this up-res output stream may appear to correspond to 1920 X 1080
                        HD, the original image itself is still only 860 pixels worth of resolution which barely exceeds standard def!
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="text-primary font20">It's all about the glass!</h3>
                    <p>With Spectra's new V3-S dedicated 8mm gate and its correct optics, we can
                        now use the entire surface area of the chip in the Spirit allowing for the first, true 1920 pixel scan
                        (more than double the resolution of the 16mm modification)! The only limitation will be the film itself!</p>

                    <h3>Super 8 Millennium vs Spirit Comparison Video</h3>
                    <p>Special thanks to Christian Schneider for producing a direct,
                        unbiased comparison of the same 8mm footage transferred on
                        our Spirit SDC 2000 at 1080 resolution versus a competitor's
                        Millennium II at 2K uncompressed resolution. Both the BW and
                        color films are somewhat grainy due to high film ASA, format and
                        lighting. The example shows the Spirit producing more crisp
                        detail, accurate color with no additional digital noise. Proof that a
                        more advanced capturing array, superior optics and a trained
                        colorist at the controls will continue to lead the pack in quality.
                        This explains why only the very best facilities still use the Spirit
                        telecine for professional work while Millennium and the newer
                        budget scan machines on the market fail to measure up even
                        though they may claim to offer "more resolution". As a million
                        dollar machine, the Spirit was designed with amazing optics and
                        capturing that currently surpass all the competitors regardless of
                        their claims. See the difference Spirit makes!</p>

                    <h3>16mm 3K vs Spirit Comparison</h3>
                    <p>Thanks to another client of ours for a
                        direct comparison of 16mm transferred
                        on our Spirit at 1080 resolution ( far right)
                        versus a competitor's Bayer scanner at 3K
                        resolution (left). Both versions were
                        professionally color corrected by each
                        facility for finished editing and viewing.</p>
                    <p>Again, the example shows that Spectra's
                        Spirit and trained colorists provide much
                        better detail and color. Leaves and bark
                        on the tree appear colorful and detailed
                        while the 3K scan tends to be soft and
                        washed out. The positive black and white
                        Spirit image also shows much more
                        dynamic range and crisp detail of tree
                        branches while there is little to see from
                        the 3K version.</p>

                        scanner may suggest a 3K capture spec,
                        there are system shortcomings that
                        significantly effect picture resulting in less
                        actual resolution. Low budget Bayer
                        scanners of today still can not compare to

                color corrections would need to be done with the raw files within our Nucoda color suite (or elsewhere) at additional
                cost. While additional time and/or billing may be required for color grading as a separate step, this method is the
                most affordable option while capturing from film! An unsupervised session is billed at a flat 2:1 ratio based on film
                run time.</p>
            <h3 class="text-primary">Unsupervised Scene to Scene (recommended!) </h3>
            <p>Available on Spirit scanner or Nucoda color suite. Intended for

                footage and adjusts color and exposure as needed within any scene lasting 10 seconds or longer! This form of color
                correction greatly reduces the amount of correction work required during editing for much smoother work flow and
                lower grading cost down the road. This is Spectra's recommended choice! An unsupervised session is billed at a flat
                3:1 ratio based on film run time. </p>

                shots on color and exposure with the help of a qualified in-house operator provided by Spectra. While this form of
                color correction can be the most intensive, it is usually by far the most expensive! Sessions are billed by the hour

            <p>Spectra now offers instant remote server accessibility to fully editable film transfer dailies from any computer in the world. This means that a director in New York, editor in Los Angeles and DP in Brazil can all gain accessibility to film dailies for expedited editing and creative decision making. Our cloud also doubles as your file vault for 30 days in case previously downloaded files are accidentally corrupted or deleted.</p>
            <p>The drawback is that download times, while usually faster than shipping, can take several hours or more depending on file size and user internet connections. Considering this we suggest the following:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Download from wired connection with 50Mbs or faster service. Wireless connections not recommended!</li>
                <li>Be sure your computer settings do not activate "sleep" mode or shut down during the download.</li>
                <li>Avoid using internet for other purposes while downloading to reduce the chance of errors or corruption.</li>
                <li>Try to restrict cloud downloads to files under 30 Gigabytes each</li>
                <li>Be prepared for slow download speeds depending on providers and distance (1.5MBps average)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>To test your connection, please <strong><a href="http://spectrafilm.ddns.net:8080/login" target="_blank">log onto our cloud server</a></strong> and start the download of a 5GB test file. This will allow you to properly gauge download speeds from your location with some accuracy:</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">Client Media Requirements</h2>
            <p>Spectra permits clients to supply their own media for transfers as a cost savings courtesy (solely at the risk
                of the client). There is no extra charge for this courtesy if the basic guidelines are followed. However,
                Spectra does not provide a guarantee or warranty on transfers when using customer supplied media. We
                require fully compatible hard drives or tapes that will allow us to complete your job in a timely manner without
                incurring extra cost or delays. Saving us time saves you money, so, please be aware of the mandatory
                requirements below if you wish to avoid any additional charges.</p>
            <h3 class="font20 text-primary">Client Supplied Hard Drives</h3>
            <p>Please note that we purge all files from our computer immediately after
                your file transfer has been completed unless additional file vaulting service has been purchased! This
                service is available at reasonable cost and recommended as added protection of your files that may be
                accidentally deleted, damaged or lost in transit. If you wish to have your files vaulted please let us know in
                advance!</p>
            <p>To avoid additional service charges (such as reformatting, etc) we require that you provide a drive filling all
                the following requirements without exception! Please read carefully below:</p>
            <p><strong>Drive Requirements:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Be sure drive is formatted partition-free as Mac OS extended - journaled, Windows NTFS or exFAT and
                    compatible with Mac OSX 10.6.8 operating system. Windows FAT32 format is not compatible for moving large
                    files and will incur a 25.00 service fee!</li>
                <li>Drive must be capable of either USB 3.0 or 800 firewire minimum transfer speeds. Any required data or
                    power cables must be included. Data cable must plug into a standard USB 3.0 type A or 800 firewire host
                    connection. Drive must be plug and play (no software requirement). Any needed power cords must plug into a US
                    standard 60Hz 120V wall socket.</li>
                <li>Drive must function properly and have adequate disc space for job completion.</li>
                <li>A drive filling our requirements must be bundled with the film at the time we are ready to start the scan or we
                    will automatically proceed with an in-house supplied flash drive billed at our regular list rate or charge file vaulting
                    fee (whichever is least expensive). We do not exchange drives.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 class="font20 text-primary">Potential Service Charges</h3>
            <p>We must have your drive filling all the requirements above when we start your
                session or a $25.00 mandatory vaulting fee covering file storage for 30 days will be charged. Any missing
                elements that we must supply (such as data cables or power cord) will require a mandatory $25.00 service
                charge. Any needed Mac reformatting is $25.00 per drive and will delete any existing files. If your files are
                not vaulted with us and you can not recover them from your drive due to damage or loss, we charge a
                minimum $175.00 file recovery fee (if files can still be restored from our computer). Any vaulting,
                reformatting or missing element fees may be waived if a new drive is purchased directly from Spectra to
                complete the given job in a timely, efficient manner (see "New Media" above). Remember - saving us time
                always saves you money!</p>
            <h3 class="font20 text-primary">Client Supplied Tapes</h3>
            New, virgin Sony brand tapes only. Proper tapes must be bundled with the film
            at the time we are ready to start the transfer or we will automatically proceed with in-house supplied stock
            (billed to the client at our regular list rate above). We do not exchange tapes.
